Please be aware that we are not including the raw SNP data available through the Medicago HapMap project.
We can provide it upon a request if the HapMap project is no longer available. We just did not want to add superfluous data to the Zenodo servers if the data is already readily available elsewhere.

We also are not including the filtered SNP data for a similar reason since this is also easily obtained from the raw data.
The files are several 100 Gbs and it seems excessive to place on a public repository.
We provide the scripts for processing the raw data into readable formats for input starting all the way from the raw SNP data in the Medicago HapMap.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
